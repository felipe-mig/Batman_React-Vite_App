## 📄 Description

🌕🦇This is a React app project built with Vite, based on the Batman universe. The app is built with components that are dynamically rendered using control functions.
The content of the different sections is displayed using a function that reads data from a JSON file. Therefore, to update the content, the user only needs to change the information in the JSON file.

* 🚫🤖 No AI code 
* 📁 Local content

The website is optimized for a 16" 2560x1600 display with a 16:10 aspect ratio.

♦️ To run the app using the **React + Vite** environment (assuming you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed), enter these commands on your terminal:

* npm create vite@latest testBatmanApp -- --template react
* cd testBatmanApp
* npm install
* npm run dev

Finally, uncompress the src.rar and replace the **src** directory of your recently created React environment with the one in this repository.
